Run a code review using Alibaba Coding Plan models.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes
- Your only job is to run the review and return the output verbatim to the user

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run the review in the foreground
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run the review in a Claude background task
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant working-tree status is empty or the explicit branch diff is empty
  - Recommend waiting only when the review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself
- Do not add extra review instructions or rewrite the user's intent

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/coding-plan-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output

Background flow:
- Launch the review with `Bash` in the background:
```typescript
Bash({
  command: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/coding-plan-companion.mjs" review "$ARGUMENTS"`,
  description: "Coding Plan review",
  run_in_background: true
})
```
- Do not call `BashOutput` or wait for completion in this turn
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Coding Plan review started in the background. Check `/coding-plan:status` for progress."

Examples:
```bash
/coding-plan:review
/coding-plan:review --base main
/coding-plan:review --background
/coding-plan:review --model qwen3.6-plus
```
